Edge Intelligent Computing (EIC) is an emerging technology paradigm appealing for extensive
							 Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios such as environment monitoring, disaster warning, meta 
							 cyberspace. However, low power and constrained hardware resources impose critical design
							  challenges in the process of EIC systemsâ€™ real-world implementation. In this workshop,
							   we are not only interested in the advanced edge computing technologies, but also bring 
							   a focus on how to implement the computation-/data-intensive machine learning algorithms 
							   on IoT edge devices. The workshop will bring together both scientists and engineers from 
							   academia and industry who are working on Edge Intelligent Computing architectures and systems.
							   The topics of the workshop will include but not limit to the following topics:
